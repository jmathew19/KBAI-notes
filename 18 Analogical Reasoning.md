### Introduction to Analogical Reasoning
- **Definition**:
  - Understanding new problems using **previously known problem structures**.
  - Transfers knowledge of **relationships across different domains**.
- **Topics Covered**:
  1. **Similarity & Case-Based Reasoning**.
  2. **Retrieval, Mapping, and Transport in Analogical Reasoning**.
  3. **Design by Analogy** (Biomimicry in AI).

### The Concept of Similarity
![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.39.46 PM.png]]
- **Example**: Woman climbing a ladder vs. similar activities.
- **Types of Similarity**:
  - **Object similarity** (woman-ladder vs. woman-stairs).
  - **Relationship similarity** (climbing up a ladder vs. painting a ladder).
- **Similarity Metrics**:
  - **Objects involved**.
  - **Relationships between objects**.
  - **Features & values of objects**.

### Case-Based Reasoning & Similarity
- **Nearest-Neighbor Matching**:
  - Finds the **closest problem case** from past experience.
  - used euclidean distance or other metric
- **Discrimination Tree Approach**:
  - Organizes cases **based on distinguishing features**.
  - new problem comes we traverse tree and find most closest answer
- **Cross-Domain Analogies**:
  - Example: **Climbing a ladder vs. an ant climbing a wall**.
  - Similarity is determined by **conceptual relationships, not objects**.

### Cross-Domain Analogical Transfer: The Radiation Problem
- **Scenario**:
  - A doctor must destroy a tumor using **a high-intensity laser**, however the laser will also destroy near by healthy tissues and kill the patient
  - What should the doctor do?![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.48.39 PM.png]]
- **Solution via Analogy**:
  - **Military Strategy**:
    - Tyrant king puts mines on roads to prevent opposition from rising,
    - A rebel army then **splits into smaller groups** to attack a fort from multiple roads.
    - The attack succeeds **without triggering mines**.![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.46.45 PM.png]]
  - **Transfer to Medicine**:
    - Split the high-intensity laser into **multiple weaker beams** from different directions.
    - Weak beams **converge on the tumor**, destroying it without harming healthy tissue.

  in the previous example we see why the any climbing wall is similar to women walking ladder

### Spectrum of Similarity
![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 3.52.47 PM.png]]
- **High Similarity**:
	- Identical objects, features, and relationships.
	- Recording cases (colored blocks from block world)
- **Moderate Similarity**:
	- Objects are different, but **relationships are similar**.
	- case based reasoning Navigation in urban area example
- **Low Similarity**
	- Analogical reasoning
	- Comparing the laser radiation problem with the army split problem
- **No Similarity**:
	- Neither objects nor relationships match.

### The Analogical Reasoning Process![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 4.00.11 PM.png]]
1. **Retrieval**: Find a **relevant past case**.
2. **Mapping**: Align **corresponding elements** between source and target problems.
3. **Transfer**: Apply the **abstracted relationship** to the new problem.
4. **Evaluation**: Test if the analogy **correctly solves the new problem**.
5. **Storage**: Save the **new solution** for future reference.

### Analogical Retrieval![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 4.03.31 PM.png]]
- **Relationship between object**s - we see the diamond in A relates the the dot in A
- **Challenges**:
  - **Source and target problems come from different domains**.
  - **Objects & values differ**, but relationships remain.
- **Example**:
  - **Atomic structure** is often explained using the **solar system model**.
  - Electrons **revolve around** the nucleus just like planets around the Sun.

### Three types of Similarities ![[Screenshot 2025-03-17 at 4.12.09 PM.png]]
- **Semantics** - Conceptual similarity between the target problem and the source case (woman climbing ladder to ant climbing wall)
- **Pragmatic** - Similarity of external factors such as goals (The laser, cancer simialr to castle, army)
- **Structural** - Similarity between representational structures not physical,

### Analogical Mapping
- **Challenge: The Correspondence Problem**:
  - **Which object in the target problem corresponds to which object in the source problem?**
  - **Example**:
    - **Laser beam → Rebel army** (both act as distributed forces).
    - **Tumor → Fort** (both require a multi-angle attack).
- **Higher-Order Relationships**:
  - Objects may differ, but **similar causal structures** make mapping possible.

### Analogical Transfer
- **Extracting a Generalizable Pattern**:
  - **Break a large force into smaller parts**.
  - **Attack from multiple angles**.
- **Applying the Pattern**:
  - **Military Strategy → Medical Treatment**.
  - **Physics → Electronics (Solar System → Atomic Model)**.

We can transfer the goal and solution between similar problems

### Biomimicry: Design by Analogy
- **Examples**:
  - **Shinkansen Bullet Train**:
    - Modeled after the **Kingfisher’s beak** to reduce noise.
  - **Mercedes-Benz Bionic Car**:
    - Inspired by the **Boxfish**, which moves efficiently in water.

### Biomimicry in Robotics
- **Designing a robot that walks on water**:
  - **Inspired by Basilisk Lizard**.
  - Requires a deep understanding of **biological locomotion**.
- We can cop the behavior of lizard that walks on water to robot that walks on ground

### Advanced Research Topics in Analogical Reasoning
1. **Common Vocabulary Challenge**:
   - Can AI align concepts **if different words are used**?
2. **Problem Transformation**:
   - How much **abstraction is needed** to retrieve useful analogies?
3. **Compound Analogy**:
   - AI might use **multiple analogies simultaneously**.
4. **Visual-Spatial Analogies**:
   - Can AI reason over **images instead of words**?
5. **Conceptual Combination**:
   - **Merging analogies** to form **new concepts**.

### Analogies in Everyday Cognition
- **Metaphors**:
  - "All the world’s a stage" → **Shakespearean analogy**.
- **Raven’s Progressive Matrices**:
  - **IQ tests use analogy-based reasoning** to assess intelligence.
