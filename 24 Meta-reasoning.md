# Lecture 24: Meta-Reasoning in AI

Video ID: GRjfbP3dPWA
### Introduction to Meta-Reasoning
- **Definition**:
  - **Thinking about thinking**.
  - **Knowledge about knowledge**.
  - AI **reasoning about its own knowledge, reasoning, and learning**.
- **Example**:
  - If asked for President Obama's **telephone number**, you **immediately know** you donâ€™t know it.
  - But **how do you know that you donâ€™t know?**
- **Connections to Previous Topics**:
  - **Learning by Correcting Mistakes**: AI reflecting on **errors in knowledge**.
  - **Meta-Reasoning goes beyond**: AI can analyze **errors in reasoning and learning**.
- **Topics Covered**:
  1. **Errors in Reasoning and Learning**.
  2. **Gaps in Knowledge**.
  3. **Strategy Selection & Integration**.
  4. **Meta-Meta-Reasoning**.
  5. **Goal-Based Autonomy**.

### Meta-Reasoning Over Knowledge, Reasoning, and Learning
- **Examples**:
  - **Knowledge Errors**:
    - AI incorrectly classifies an object.
    - Must **reflect on stored knowledge** and correct it.
  - **Reasoning Errors**:
    - AI reaches a **logical dead-end** and must revise its approach.
  - **Learning Errors**:
    - AI learns an incorrect rule and **must revise its learning process**.
- **Example: Blocks World**:
  - AI **plans a sequence of moves**, but reaches a **cul-de-sac**.
  - It must **reconsider its reasoning strategy**.

### Gaps in Knowledge, Reasoning, and Learning
- **Example: Explanation-Based Learning**:
  - AI **tries to connect knowledge**, but **lacks a crucial fact**.
  - It must **identify the missing knowledge** and set a **learning goal**.
- **Example: Reasoning Gaps**:
  - AI **gets stuck** using a flawed strategy.
  - It must recognize the **need for a different reasoning approach**.

### Overlapping Boundaries Between Meta-Reasoning and Deliberation
- **Meta-Reasoning vs. Deliberation**:
  - **Blurred boundaries**: Some processes could be **both meta-reasoning and deliberation**.
  - **Example**:
    - AI **detects a gap in its knowledge**.
    - It sets a **new reasoning goal** to fill the gap.
    - This process **involves both meta-reasoning and deliberation**.

### Strategy Selection in Meta-Reasoning
- **Selecting an AI Strategy**:
  - AI **knows multiple reasoning methods**.
  - **Meta-Reasoning chooses the best method** for a given problem.
- **Factors in Choosing a Strategy**:
  1. **Knowledge Availability**:
     - Some methods require **specific knowledge** (e.g., case-based reasoning needs labeled cases).
  2. **Computational Efficiency**:
     - Some methods **solve problems faster** than others.
  3. **Solution Quality**:
     - Logic provides **high-quality solutions**, but may be **slow**.

### Strategy Integration in AI
- **AI Should Switch Between Strategies**:
  - **Example: Case-Based Reasoning**:
    - Uses **past cases** to solve problems.
    - **Meta-Reasoning** decides how to adapt solutions (e.g., via rules or models).
- **Example: Blocks World**:
  - AI starts with **means-ends analysis**.
  - If it **reaches a dead-end**, it **switches to problem reduction**.
  - After breaking the problem into smaller goals, it **returns to means-ends analysis**.

### Meta-Reasoning Uses AIâ€™s Own Strategies
- **Meta-Reasoning Strategies**:
  - **Case-Based Reasoning**: "What method worked for a similar problem before?"
  - **Planning**: "What is the best sequence of reasoning methods?"
  - **Generate & Test**: "Try multiple methods, evaluate their effectiveness."
- **Example**:
  - AI **failed using one method**, so it **switches** to a better approach.

### Does Meta-Meta-Reasoning Exist?
- **Could AI reason about its own meta-reasoning?**
  - **No additional layer needed**.
  - **Meta-Reasoning already applies to itself**.
  - **Recursively evaluates its own decision-making**.

### Example: A Camera-Assembling Robot
- **Scenario**:
  - A robot **assembles cameras** daily.
  - One day, it's **asked to disassemble** a camera.
  - It **wasnâ€™t programmed for this**, so it must **adapt**.
- **Steps in Meta-Reasoning**:
  1. **Gap Recognition**:
     - The robot realizes it has **no procedure for disassembling**.
  2. **Strategy Selection**:
     - It chooses **case-based reasoning** since it **knows how to assemble**.
  3. **Strategy Integration**:
     - It uses **rule-based reasoning** to **reverse assembly steps**.
  4. **Meta-Meta-Reasoning**:
     - The robot **analyzes its own strategy selection**.
     - It realizes **case-based reasoning was too slow**.
     - **Next time, it will try a different approach**.

### Meta-Reasoning Throughout the Course
- **Examples of Meta-Reasoning**:
  - **Learning from Mistakes**: AI **corrects its own errors**.
  - **Planning**: AI **balances multiple strategies**.
  - **Production Systems**: AI **resolves impasses** by **learning new rules**.
  - **Diagnosis**: AI **diagnoses its own failures in reasoning**.

### Meta-Reasoning in Course Design
- **Course Structure Uses Meta-Reasoning**:
  - Lessons **start with an example problem**.
  - Students **solve the problem first**.
  - The course **then explains how AI can solve it**.
  - This approach **teaches meta-reasoning skills**.

### Meta-Reasoning in Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices
- **How to Design an AI with Meta-Reasoning?**
  - AI **should select the best method** for each problem.
  - AI **can use multiple strategies**, not just one.
  - **Meta-Reasoning decides**:
    - **Which method to use**.
    - **How to adjust when it fails**.
    - **How to optimize performance**.
