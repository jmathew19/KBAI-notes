### Cognitive Architecture of AI Agents
- **Three Spaces of AI Reasoning**:
  1. **Reactive Space**:
     - AI directly **maps input to action**.
     - **Example**: A thermostat turns off when it reaches a temperature.
  2. **Deliberative Space**:
     - AI **reasons** before acting.
     - Uses **memory, learning, and reasoning**.
  3. **Meta-Cognitive Space**:
     - AI **reflects on its own reasoning**.
     - **Example**: AI detects **flaws in its problem-solving method** and corrects them.
- **AI in Social & Physical Worlds**:
  - AI **interacts with other agents** (social cognition).
  - **Receives continuous input** and **adapts to changes**.

### Seven Core Principles of Knowledge-Based AI
1. **Representation & Reasoning**:
   - AI **organizes knowledge into structured formats** (semantic networks, frames).
   - Example: **Scripts for restaurant visits** guide AI expectations.
2. **Incremental Learning**:
   - AI **learns one case at a time** (e.g., case-based reasoning).
   - Unlike deep learning, **AI builds knowledge gradually**.
3. **Top-Down & Bottom-Up Reasoning**:
   - AI **generates expectations from knowledge** (top-down).
   - AI **interprets raw input from the world** (bottom-up).
   - Example: **Constraint propagation in visual understanding**.
4. **Matching Methods to Tasks**:
   - AI **chooses the best reasoning method** for a problem.
   - Example: AI **switching between problem reduction and case-based reasoning**.
5. **Heuristics Over Optimality**:
   - AI **finds "good enough" solutions efficiently**.
   - **Example**: Means-Ends Analysis doesnâ€™t always find the best path, just a workable one.
6. **Using Recurring Patterns**:
   - AI **leverages past experiences** to solve new problems.
   - **Example**: AI designs a **stronger water pump by analogizing from electrical circuits**.
7. **Integrating Reasoning, Learning, and Memory**:
   - AI connects **what it knows (memory)**, **how it reasons (problem-solving)**, and **what it learns (adaptation)**.
